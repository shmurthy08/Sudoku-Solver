# Sudoku-Solver
Hi, this is my CPSC 406, Algorithm Analysis, class project. I am working on this with Rahul Sura and Dylan Inafuku. Our goal is to create a sudoku solver to learn more about algorithms.

Non-builtin python library dependencies:
- tabulate (`pip install tabulate`)

To run each solve method:
(Note, on windows use the `python` command and on linux, `python3`)
- Solver Method 1
    - python solver_method_1.py [SUDOKU_FILE]
